# Docs will be here

And once they are here they will be great, with Sphinx and auto synchronization
with code. They are not here yet, so please refer to code base for insights:

 * _./etc/config.cfg.sample_ contains descriptions of configurable options;
 * _logretriever -h_ produces the list of available CLI overrides for config
   options -- note, that CLI arguments override values from configuration
   file;
 * docstrings for most of the objects contain intentions, comments shed light
   on ambiguous or obscure parts, unit tests codify expected behaviour;
 * the last but no least: the code itself, which is the ultimate answer to
   any questions regarding tool behaviour.
